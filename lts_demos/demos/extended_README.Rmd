## lifeTimes: correlations in biological series data

This is a package for **detecting** and **visualising** correlations between objects in biological series data. 

Citation
--------

**lifeTimes** is available for everyone. If you find it useful for your research please cite the work that motivated its development: **Environmentally dependent and independent control of cell shape determination by Rho GTPase regulators in melanoma.** doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.11.463377

**Quick start**  
----

Install lifeTimes
```{r include=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#install devtools if needed
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

#load devtools
library(devtools)

#install dependency from github
install_github("jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap")

#install lifeTimes from github, using package access token
install_github("somaSystems/lifeTimes", 
auth_token = "<paste your github token as a string here>") 

# If you need a github token you make one with the commented code below:
# usethis::create_github_token() 
```
  
**Run lifeTimes on default data**
```{r include=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#copy and paste to run on test data
library(lifeTimes)

lts <- lts_in() #calculate cross correlation

lts_plot_ccfs(lts) #plot clustered correlations

lts_plot_ClustSum(lts) #plot direction of correlations

lts_plot_coupled(lts) # plot strength and direction of correlation
```
  
**description of default data**
lifeTimes makes it easy to detect coupling between different components of a biological systems from the scale of cells, to organisms, to ecosystems. Along these lines, lifeTimes comes loaded with subcellular and landscape scale datasets.

**Example one: Landscape scale data**
lifeTimes can be used to find coupling between processes at the landscape or ecosystem scale. For this example, we can use data from the National River Flow Archive (https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/web-download-service). We will look at two types of data, i) Gauged Daily Flows (GDF), and ii) Catchment Daily Rainfall (CDR). River flows are in cubic meters per second, and rainfall is in mm across the catchment in the given reference period (https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data-formats-types).  
<p>
For this example I have downloaded data from the Thames river, at Kingston (https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/39001), and the Ash river, at Mardock https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/38002. I have subset the data between the years 1983 and 2017. This is a period where both stations were recording measurements.  
<p>
After some data wrangling, these two datsets produce the following csv:
```{r}

rain_flow <- read.csv(file ="data-raw/rain_flow_Thames_Ash.csv")
colnames(rain_flow)
head(rain_flow)

```

To make data suitable for lifeTimes, we need the raw data, and four labels:  
<p>
**1. A unique identified for each thing we are measuring: ** So we need to find, or create a column in the data frame with unique identifier for each observation: In this dataset the column is called "key_num". An observation is some unit of interest, tracked over time. In this dataset, it's a river measuring station, in a given season, in a given year. For example, "Ash river in summer in 1995", or "Thames river in winter of 2001". So in this dataset I have grouped the data by, River,Season and Year, and given a unique ID to each observation and labelled the column  the column "key_num". 

**2. A unit of time:** So we need to find the column in the dataset that indicates time. In this data we have years, months and days, but the unit of time I am interested in is at the resolution of days. The column in the datset with days is called "dayOfseason". On the first day of each season (summer, autumn, winter, spring) this value starts at one and increments up until the end of the season.

**3. Pairs of variables to compare: ** In lifeTimes, pairs of variables to compare are stored in a list (of two variables) in a lists. 


**landscape data**
```{r}

```

**creating pairs of variables to compare**



**How to use**
------
To calculate cross correlation, just load the package, assign, and call the  ``lts <- lts_in()`` function. 
This will chain together the lifeTimes workflow on a built in set of default data and return calculated cross correlations.
<p>
To plot cross correlations, just call ``lts_plot_ccfs(lts)``.  

<p>
To plot clustered lead vs lag metrics which emphasise the direction of coupling, 
just call ``lts_plot_ClustSum(lts)``.  

<p>
Finally, to plot coupling plots, incorporating both strength and direction 
of coupling, just call ``lts_plot_coupled(lts)``.
  
**Example data**
--------

Example data are yearly cross correlation functions (CCFs) of rainfall and river flow rates for two different rivers in the United Kingdom, the Ash and Thames rivers. CCFs are calculated and plotted separately based on two explanatory variables, season (summer, autumn, winter, spring), and catchment region (Mardock, Kingston).

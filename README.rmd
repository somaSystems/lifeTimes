## lifeTimes: correlations in biological series data

This is a package for **detecting** and **visualising** correlations between objects in biological series data. 

Citation
--------

**lifeTimes** is available for everyone. If you find it useful for your research please cite the work that motivated its development: **Environmentally dependent and independent control of cell shdepre4cated)READNEAape determination by Rho GTPase regulators in melanoma.** doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.11.463377

**Quick start**  
----

Install lifeTimes
```{r include=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#install devtools if needed
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

#load devtools
library(devtools)

#install from github, using package access token
install_github("somaSystems/lifeTimes", 
auth_token = "<paste your github token as a string here>") 

# If you need a github token you make one with the commented code below:
# usethis::create_github_token() 
```
  
Run lifeTimes on default data
```{r include=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#copy and paste to run on test data
library(lifeTimes)

lts <- lts_in() #calculate cross correlation

lts_plot_ccfs(lts) #plot clustered correlations

lts_plot_ClustSum(lts) #plot direction of correlations

lts_plot_coupled(lts) # plot strength and direction of correlation
```
  
  **How to use**
------
To calculate cross correlation, just load the package, assign, and call the  ``lts <- lts_in()`` function. 
This will chain together the lifeTimes workflow on a built in set of default data and return calculated cross correlations.
<p>
To plot cross correlations, just call ``lts_plot_ccfs(lts)``.  

<p>
To plot clustered lead vs lag metrics which emphasise the direction of coupling, 
just call ``lts_plot_ClustSum(lts)``.  

<p>
Finally, to plot coupling plots, incorporating both strength and direction 
of coupling, just call ``lts_plot_coupled(lts)``.
  
**Example data**
--------

Example data are yearly cross correlation functions (CCFs) of rainfall and river flow rates for two different rivers in the United Kingdom, the Ash and Thames rivers. CCFs are calculated and plotted separately based on two explanatory variables, season (summer, autumn, winter, spring), and catchment region (Mardock, Kingston).

**Inputs**
--------
i.      Evenly spaced series data (eg. can be time or space series)
ii.     Label of the measurements taken. (eg. can be shape or signal intensity)
iii.    Labels for the objects to be compared (eg. cytoplasm and nuclear compartments)
iv.     Higher level groupings for comparing objects (eg. compare objects per cell/organism/treatment/community)


**Outputs**
--------
i.      Calculated correlations clustered by strength at lag zero  
ii.     Calculated asymmetries between past and future lags, clustered by strength of asymmetry  
iii.    'Coupling plots' representing the strength of correlation at lag zero, and the direction of correlation

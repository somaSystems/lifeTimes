## lifeTimes: correlations in biological series data

This is a package for **detecting** and **visualising** correlations between objects in (biological) series data. 

**Description**
--------
The package currently has 5 user exposed functions.  

1. ``lts_lifeTimesChain``The purpose of this function is to process user input by call each of the computational functions in the correct order.
2. ``lts_clusterPlot(), lts_leadLagClusterPlot(), lts_couplingPlot()``. The purpose of these functions is to plot the output of ``lts_lifeTimesChain``

Currently all input is default data, but there will be two types of user input. 
1. Time series data
2. User defined variables, which tell the functions called by lts_lifeTimesChain() how to process the time series data.

Currently, both types of user can be put input into ``lts_defineVars()``, which is the first function called by ``lts_lifeTimesChain()``.

**Outputs**
--------
i.      Calculated correlations clustered by strength at lag zero  
ii.     Calculated asymmetries between past and future lags, clustered by strength of asymmetry  
iii.    'Coupling plots' representing the strength of correlation at lag zero, and the direction of correlation
